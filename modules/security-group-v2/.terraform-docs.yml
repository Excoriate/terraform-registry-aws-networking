    # ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Security Group Module
    ## Description
    {{ .Header }}
    This module provides a way to create a security group with a set of rules.
    * üöÄ A security group, with standard rules.
    * üöÄ A security group, with a set of rules.
    This module is also capable of looking up for the VPC id if it's not provided. If the variable `vpc_id` is not provided, the module will use the values passed into the input variable 'var.vpc_lookup_config' to look for either the default VPC, or a named VPC using the tag 'Name' as its search criteria. If the VPC is not found, the module will throw an error.

    ## Example
    Examples of this module's usage are available in the [examples](./examples) folder.

    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../examples/security-group/basic/main.tf" }}
    ```

    An example of multiple security groups, created at once:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../examples/security-group-v2/basic/config/fixtures-multiple-only-sg.tfvars" }}
    ```
    An example of a security group that's created passing its VPC, as the default VPC:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../examples/security-group/basic/config/fixtures-with-default-vpc.tfvars" }}
    ```
    An example of a security group that's pointing or looking for a VPC with a specific name:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../examples/security-group/basic/config/fixtures-with-named-vpc.tfvars" }}
    ```

    For module composition, It's recommended to take a look at the module's `outputs` to understand what's available:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "outputs.tf" }}
    ```
